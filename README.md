## Features
- Use the helmets on the side of the suits rack to switch between dog and human model!
- Replaces your 3D model, adjusts your height, updates the health UI.
- Compatible with custom suits!
- Compatible with 3rd person & mirror!
- The mod works in multiplayer with players who do not have it! They will just see everyone as a human.
- Limited compatibility with emotes!
- **[NEW]** Compatible with MoreCompany cosmetics! Cosmetics are hidden in dog mode.

## Limitations
- Not compatible with model replacing mods (e.g. ModelReplacementAPI, etc.)
- In dog mode:
	- held scrap can easily clip and fall through the ship and world floor, especially when crouching
		- jumping before dropping and looking up helps prevent this!
	- snare fleas will appear to float above you
	- if you turn into a masked enemy, you will still be a human
