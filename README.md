## Changelog

**[1.0.0]**
- Updated to LC_API_V50. Added compatibility with MoreCompany which hides cosmetics when in dog mode.

**[1.0.1]**
- Fixed issue causing your own MoreCompany cosmetics to be visible in first-person. Also added dependency to x753-More_Suits since this mod tends to work best with it.

**[1.0.2]**
- Dog model ragdolls no longer have MoreCompany cosmetics floating above them. Fixed audio issue where model toggle clips played on respawn.
